<!--
PHASE 1 COMMENTARY
Phase 1 focuses on gathering all necessary context and preparing detailed test plans before any test code is written. This ensures:
- All key components and hooks in the client are identified for testing.
- The Jest setup and configuration are clearly documented for consistency.
- Each major component and hook will have a dedicated test plan, outlining what will be tested and why, before implementation begins.

Each research and planning task will have its findings documented in `/.planning/context/` for transparency and future reference. No test code will be written until all test plans are complete and approved.

# Test Plan for Client Project (Jest)


## Goal
Create comprehensive Jest test coverage for the client project, including a test plan for each test before implementation.

---


### Phase 1: Research and Test Planning
**Objective:** Gather context, identify testable components, and create detailed test plans for each area.

| Task ID | Description | Prerequisite | Status | Notes |
|---------|-------------|--------------|--------|-------|
| 1.1     | Research existing client code structure and identify key components for testing | -- | Done | 2025-05-14: Key components and hooks identified, see context/task-1.1-research.md |
| 1.2     | Document Jest setup and configuration for the client | 1.1 | Done | 2025-05-14: Jest best practices and config documented, see context/task-1.2-jest-recommendation.md |
| 1.3     | Create test plans for each major component and hook (using colocated tests) | 1.2 | In Progress | Started: 2025-05-14 |

---


### Phase 2: Test Implementation
**Objective:** Implement Jest tests as per the approved test plans.

| Task ID | Description | Prerequisite | Status | Notes |
|---------|-------------|--------------|--------|-------|
| 2.1     | Write and organize Jest tests for components | 1.3 | Done | 2025-05-14: All component tests implemented and colocated. |
| 2.2     | Write and organize Jest tests for hooks | 1.3 | Done | 2025-05-14: All hook tests implemented and colocated. |
| 2.3     | Ensure all tests pass and coverage is reported | 2.1, 2.2 | Done | 2025-05-14: All tests passing, coverage reporting to Codecov and GitHub Pages. |

---


### Phase 3: Review and Documentation
**Objective:** Review test coverage, document outcomes, and finalize the process.

| Task ID | Description | Prerequisite | Status | Notes |
|---------|-------------|--------------|--------|-------|
| 3.1     | Review test coverage and identify gaps | 2.3 | In Progress | 2025-05-14: Coverage reports and badges available for both client and server. |
| 3.2     | Document test outcomes and update README | 3.1 | Pending | -- |
| 3.3     | Archive planning and context files | 3.2 | Pending | -- |

---


**Next Steps:**

- For each research and planning task, findings will be documented in `/.planning/context/`.
- No test code will be written until you approve the full plan and the test plans for each component/hook.
